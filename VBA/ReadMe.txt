The original game was a console based game from the 1980s.
It is a simple game (see "Original Rules" below).

Converted it into VBA from an old dot matrix print off that was found of the code. The High_Voltage.xlsm workbook is the full game.

The "VisualBasic" subfolder is a dump of the High_Voltage.xlsm workbook's VBA.

This Repo is just for fun and Repo play.
